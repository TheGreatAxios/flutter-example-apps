   Flutter RxDart Hive - Example #1

   This application is focused on the two main technologies/packages that I use within many of my Flutter applications. 

   1. RxDart -> RxDart is a package that focuses on building extra functionality ontop of the Flutter Streams. The Reactive Programming style makes it very easy to have your data be the deciding factor on when to show different UI's within an application, or even just deciding whether to run a background function or not.

   2. Hive -> An on-device data store that utilize JSON data. It is essentially a NoSQL database on device, as opposed to Sqflite which is an on-deivce SQL memory store.

   Here are some other resources for these two technologies: RxDart and Hive. I will add more over time!

### Notes on this Repo

   I built this repo and first application for somebody asking on Reddit. I am more than happy to build other Flutter examples with different technologies, tutorials, walkthroughs, etc. Please just ask for what you would like.
   I can also build out APIs to match and show the entire platform from top to bottom. 

#### Contributing

   If you have an application that you feel shows off a nice stack of packages on Flutter, please fork this repo, create a new branch, create a PR and tag me @TheGreatAxios. I will review it and reach out with any quesitons, and then hopefully merge it in so we can continue to help the community grow.
