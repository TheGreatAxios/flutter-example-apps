# flutter_rxdart_hive

Flutter Example Application for Learning -> Focus on RxDart and Hive

## About this Application

   This application was originally requested by a user on Reddit. The app itself is quite simple. It allows a user to create,
   edit, delete todos and store them in the Hive data store. So you can manipulate them, close the app, and when pulling it back up;
   the todos should all load without a problem.

   Focuses: RxDart and Hive

## Running this App

   This needs to be tested more thoroughly, but I believe cloning the main repo should suffice for now, CD into this directory and then simply install the dependencies and run the application.
   I will work on creating submodules within Github in the future so you can clone just one application at a time.
